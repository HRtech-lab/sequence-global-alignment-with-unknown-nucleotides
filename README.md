# A Python Program / Project

**This is a Python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the sixth semester class Bioinformatics
and is one of the final projects for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A Python script that for a parameter k, calculates the universal alignment of 2 sequences, with limitation that the alignment contains at most k unknown nucleotides. Nucleotide sequences are sometimes written in a 5-character alphabet, A, T, G, C, and N where N stands for an undefined nucleotide. A sequence with an N nucleotide is referred to as a degenerate sequence. Generally, a sequence with k unknown nucleotides has 4^k different interpretations.

> #### Strategy explanation
>
>A player, in order to be able to win the game described in this exercise, must find himself in 2 cases:
> 1. Case 1
>>Equal length on both chromosomes.
> 2. Case 2
>>At least one chromosome shall have a length of 0. <br>
>
>Therefore, every time we play, we try to find ourselves in the above situations in order to defeat our opponent. 

> #### About this project
>
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .py archive
